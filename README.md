# RandomPassGenerator
a random password generator using HTML/CSS/Javascript

- My motivation for this project is too start utilizing JavaScript to help me get familiar with some of the functions of JS.
- my goal is to utilize and showcase some the skills a bit of what I have studied in terms of javascript thus far in my coding journey.
- This will help my implicate and rule out anything I have or have not learned so far in my Javascript journey
- I learned a bit about JavaScript (Declaring variables using var, operators, if statements and developing functions, methods, events, scopes) now it's just putting anything i've learned within the first week into practice.
